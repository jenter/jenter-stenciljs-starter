## Utilizing with GrapesJS

To utilize within GrapesJS, I have been publishing to [https://www.npmjs.com/package/jenter-stenciljs-starter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jenter-stenciljs-starter) and then including the reference as dream-well PR #3969. So if you do not permission to publish to this NPM repo, just create your own to publish to.
